# basic data structures

before array, there are both set and list.

* set: the types of elements in a set may be different and there is no order for these elements.

* list: linear list, finite and ordered, its length is changeable.

* array: in C++, the elements in an array are the same type. in Python, there is list which allows different data types.

In the computer, we have array and linked list. Associated with the array, the index is basically the address or location of any element in the array that has the linear and consecutive physical storage underlying.

The way to access and modify any element in a data structure such as array, linked list, and binary tree is limited to its implementations of a particular programming language.

| op | array | linked list |
| -- | ----- | ----------- |
| read/write | index | traverse with next pointer |
| search | index |  traverse |
| insert | dynamic change | modify the pointer |
| delete | shift | modify the pointer |
