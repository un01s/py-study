| -------- | -------- |
| [21: merge two sorted lists](https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-two-sorted-lists/) | [02-21](https://github.com/un01s/py-study/blob/main/basics/02-linkedlist/02-21.cpp) |

## Recursive

### 21. merge two sorted lists

This is not a fair comparison because both python and Go use the recursive while cpp uses two-pointer approach.
